# Task 2 - Closed Knight’s Tour on an 𝑛×𝑛 Board

## Problem Description

Is it possible for a chess knight to visit all the cells of an 8 × 8 chessboard exactly once, ending at a cell one knight’s move away from the starting cell? (Such a tour is called closed or re-entrant. Note that a cell is considered visited only when the knight lands on it, not just passes over it on its move.) What if the chessboard is n × n? is all n where n>8 is possible for a chess knight to visit all the cells? If not, what is the cases? 

design a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of moves the chess knight needs. And study the different cases of n
